# Instructions for Problem Writers

Replace all filler with your own information. This is what will go in HackerRank.

Modify mkin.py to print the problem input to the console.

Run genSamples.sh to only generate the inputs for the sample cases. You may want special checks on test number if you want to generate a certain number of very large tests. 

Run runSampleInput.sh to generate sample outputs using your **correct** solution (solutions/sol.py). Make sure these are valid.

Run testgen.sh to generate the remaining test cases. Modify this if you need more/fewer test cases. The cases.zip file is what will be uploaded to HackerRank.
